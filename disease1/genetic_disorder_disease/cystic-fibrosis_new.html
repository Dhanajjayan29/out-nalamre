                            Cystic fibrosis is a hereditary disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that can clog the airways and lead to severe respiratory and digestive problems.

                            Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which results in the production of thick mucus. The risk factors include:

                            <li>Both parents must be carriers of the mutated CFTR gene for a child to inherit the disease.</li>
