                        <p>
                            Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, and other organs. In SLE, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, leading to inflammation, damage, and sometimes dysfunction of affected organs. SLE is more common in women, especially those of childbearing age, and can range from mild to severe.

                            <li><b>Genetic Predisposition:</b> Family history plays a role in increasing the likelihood of developing lupus. Certain genes are associated with an increased risk of the disease, especially in those with a first-degree relative diagnosed with lupus.</li>
                            <li><b>Environmental Triggers:</b> Exposure to certain environmental factors, such as sunlight, infections, or chemicals, may trigger lupus in individuals with a genetic predisposition.</li>
                            <li><b>Hormonal Influence:</b> Lupus is more common in women, especially during reproductive years, suggesting that hormones, particularly estrogen, may play a role in its development.</li>

                            <li><b>Butterfly Rash:</b> A distinctive rash across the cheeks and nose, shaped like a butterfly, is common in lupus patients.</li>
                            <li><b>Joint Pain:</b> Many individuals with SLE experience joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, particularly in the wrists, knees, and fingers.</li>
                            <li><b>Fatigue:</b> A common symptom, fatigue in lupus patients can be persistent and debilitating, affecting daily activities.</li>
                            <li><b>Kidney Issues:</b> Lupus can lead to inflammation in the kidneys, causing kidney damage and potential renal failure if untreated.</li>
                            <li><b>Photosensitivity:</b> People with lupus are often sensitive to sunlight, which can exacerbate skin rashes and other symptoms.</li>
                            <li><b>Chest Pain:</b> Lupus can affect the lining of the lungs and heart, leading to pleuritis (inflammation of the lung lining) or pericarditis (inflammation of the heart lining), causing chest pain.</li>
                            <li><b>Hair Loss:</b> Hair loss or thinning is a common symptom due to scalp involvement in lupus or as a side effect of treatment.</li>

                            <li><b>Corticosteroids:</b> Prednisone and other corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and control symptoms, especially during flare-ups.</li>
                            <li><b>Antimalarial Drugs:</b> Medications such as Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) help control lupus symptoms, especially skin rashes and joint pain.</li>
                            <li><b>Immunosuppressants:</b> Drugs like Azathioprine and Cyclophosphamide suppress the immune system to prevent it from attacking healthy tissue.</li>
                            <li><b>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs):</b> NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen may be used to manage joint pain and inflammation but are typically not used alone for lupus treatment.</li>
                            <li><b>Biologic Drugs:</b> Newer treatments like Belimumab (Benlysta) target specific immune system components to reduce inflammation and prevent flare-ups.</li>
