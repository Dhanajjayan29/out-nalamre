                            Gout is a form of arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. It often leads to sudden, severe attacks of pain, redness, and swelling. Gout is most commonly seen in the big toe but can affect other joints as well. It is more common in men and people with underlying health conditions.

                        <p>
                            Gout develops when there is too much uric acid in the blood, which can form crystals in the joints. Several factors contribute to the development of gout:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>High Uric Acid Levels:</b> Excess uric acid in the blood can form crystals that accumulate in the joints.</li>
                            <li><b>Dietary Factors:</b> Consuming foods high in purines, such as red meat, shellfish, and alcohol, can raise uric acid levels.</li>
                            <li><b>Genetics:</b> A family history of gout increases the likelihood of developing the condition.</li>
                            <li><b>Obesity:</b> Being overweight can lead to higher uric acid levels in the blood.</li>
                            <li><b>Chronic Kidney Disease:</b> Impaired kidney function can prevent uric acid from being efficiently eliminated from the body.</li>
                        </ul>
