                        <p>
                            Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that primarily affects the cartilage, which cushions the ends of the bones. As cartilage breaks down, bones may begin to rub against each other, leading to pain, swelling, and decreased mobility. It is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide, especially older adults.

                        <p>
                            Osteoarthritis typically develops due to a combination of factors that include aging, joint injuries, and genetic predisposition. Common risk factors include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Age: OA becomes more common with age.</li>
                            <li>Joint injuries: Previous injuries may lead to OA.</li>
                            <li>Obesity: Extra weight increases joint stress, particularly in the knees and hips.</li>
                            <li>Family history: Genetics can play a role in developing OA.</li>
                        </ul>

                            Symptoms of osteoarthritis vary depending on the severity of the condition and the joints affected. Common symptoms include:
