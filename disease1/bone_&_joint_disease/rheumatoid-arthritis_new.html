                        <p>
                            Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation in the joints. Unlike osteoarthritis, which results from wear and tear of cartilage, rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic condition where the immune system attacks the synovium (lining of the joints), leading to pain, swelling, and potential joint damage. It can also affect other organs in the body, such as the heart, lungs, and eyes.

                        <p>
                            The exact cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Common risk factors include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Age: RA is most commonly diagnosed in people between 40 and 60 years of age.</li>
                            <li>Gender: Women are more likely to develop RA than men.</li>
                            <li>Family history: Having a family member with RA increases the risk.</li>
                            <li>Smoking: Smoking is a major environmental risk factor for RA.</li>
                        </ul>

                            The symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis can vary from mild to severe. Common symptoms include:

                            <li>Rheumatoid nodules, which are firm lumps under the skin near affected joints.</li>

                            <li>Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to slow the progression of RA.</li>
                            <li>Biologics, which are newer drugs that target specific parts of the immune system.</li>
