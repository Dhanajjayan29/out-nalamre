                        <p>A stroke, also known as a Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA), is a medical condition that occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. This can happen due to a blockage in an artery (ischemic stroke) or the leaking or bursting of a blood vessel (hemorrhagic stroke).</p>

                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Causes</h4>
                        <p><b>Ischemic Stroke:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Thrombotic stroke: </b>This type of stroke occurs when a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one of the arteries supplying blood to the brain. The clot may develop in an artery that is already narrowed due to atherosclerosis (the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries), reducing blood flow to the brain.</li>
                            <li><b>Embolic stroke: </b>An embolic stroke happens when a blood clot or other debris forms elsewhere in the body (usually the heart or large arteries in the chest or neck) and travels to the brain, blocking a blood vessel.</li>
                            <li><b>Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):</b> Sometimes referred to as a "mini-stroke," a TIA is caused by a temporary disruption in blood flow to the brain. TIAs typically last only a few minutes and don't cause permanent damage. They are often warning signs of an impending stroke.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Hemorrhagic Stroke:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Intracerebral hemorrhage: </b>This type of stroke occurs when a blood vessel within the brain ruptures and leaks blood into the surrounding brain tissue, causing damage and swelling.</li>
                            <li><b>Subarachnoid hemorrhage: </b>Subarachnoid hemorrhage happens when there is bleeding into the space between the brain and the surrounding membrane (the subarachnoid space), often due to the rupture of an aneurysm (a weakened area in a blood vessel wall).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Several risk factors increase the likelihood of having a stroke. These include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
                            <li>Smoking</li>
                            <li>Diabetes</li>
                            <li>High cholesterol levels</li>
                            <li>Obesity</li>
                            <li>Physical inactivity</li>
                            <li>Family history of stroke</li>
                            <li>Age (risk increases with age)</li>
                            <li>Gender (men are more likely to have strokes, although women are more likely to die from strokes)</li>
                            <li>Previous history of stroke or TIA</li>
                            <li>Certain medical conditions such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat) and other heart diseases</li>
                            <li>Use of illicit drugs such as cocaine</li>
                        </ul>

                    <section class="mb-5">
                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Symptoms</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Numbness or weakness:</b> Typically affecting one side of the body, this can include weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg. It might feel like one side of the body is weaker or heavier than the other.</li>
                            <li><b>Trouble speaking or understanding speech: </b>Difficulty speaking clearly or coherently, slurred speech, or difficulty understanding what others are saying.</li>
                            <li><b>Confusion:</b> Sudden confusion, disorientation, or difficulty understanding what's happening.</li>
                            <li><b>Vision problems:</b> Trouble seeing in one or both eyes, such as blurred or blackened vision, or double vision.</li>
                            <li><b>Dizziness or loss of balance: </b>Sudden dizziness, loss of balance, or coordination, which can lead to difficulty walking or standing.</li>
                            <li><b>Severe headache: </b>A sudden, severe headache with no known cause, often described as the worst headache of one's life, especially in the case of a hemorrhagic stroke.</li>
                            <li><b>Trouble walking:</b> Sudden difficulty walking, loss of coordination, or lack of balance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mb-5">
                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Treatment: Modern Medicine</h4>
                        <p><b>Ischemic Stroke:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Clot-Busting Medications (Thrombolytics): </b>If the patient arrives at the hospital within a few hours of the onset of symptoms, they may receive intravenous thrombolytic therapy with medications such as alteplase (tPA) to dissolve the blood clot causing the stroke. This treatment can improve blood flow to the affected area of the brain and reduce long-term disability if administered promptly.</li>
                            <li><b>Antiplatelet Medications: </b>Drugs such as aspirin or clopidogrel may be prescribed to prevent blood clots from forming and reduce the risk of future strokes.</li>
                            <li><b>Mechanical Thrombectomy: </b>In some cases, particularly with large artery blockages, a procedure called mechanical thrombectomy may be performed. This involves using a catheter to remove the clot physically.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><b>Hemorrhagic Stroke:</b></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Control of Bleeding: </b>In cases of hemorrhagic stroke, the focus is on controlling the bleeding. This may involve surgery to repair the ruptured blood vessel, or medications to lower blood pressure and reduce bleeding.</li>
                            <li><b>Surgical Clipping or Coiling: </b>If an aneurysm is the cause of the hemorrhagic stroke, surgery may be performed to place a clip at the base of the aneurysm or insert a coil to stop the bleeding.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For all types of stroke, rehabilitation therapy, such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy, plays a vital role in recovery and regaining lost functions.</p>
