                        <p>
                            Vertigo is a type of dizziness characterized by the sensation of spinning or motion when one is not actually moving. It can make you feel like you or your surroundings are spinning or moving when they are not. Vertigo is often associated with inner ear problems, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, or Meniere's disease. It can also be caused by certain medications, head injuries, migraines, or other underlying health conditions.

                        <h3 class="text-primary section-heading">Treatment: Modern Medicine</h3>
                        <p>Treatment for vertigo depends on its underlying cause. In cases of BPPV, specific head maneuvers like the Epley maneuver may be performed to reposition the particles in the inner ear that cause vertigo. Medications such as antihistamines or anti-nausea drugs can help control symptoms. In cases where vertigo is related to an infection or inflammation, antibiotics or corticosteroids may be prescribed. For more persistent or severe cases, vestibular rehabilitation therapy or surgery may be considered. It's important to consult a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment based on the cause and severity of the condition.</p>

                            <li><b>Avoid sudden head movements:</b> Moving the head slowly and avoiding sudden movements can reduce the likelihood of triggering vertigo episodes.</li>
