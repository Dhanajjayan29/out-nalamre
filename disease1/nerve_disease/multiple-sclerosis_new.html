                        <p>
                            Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain and spinal cord. It is considered an autoimmune disease, where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues, in this case, the protective covering of nerve fibers called myelin.

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Autoimmune Response: </b>MS is considered an autoimmune disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath, leading to inflammation, damage, and disruption of nerve signaling.</li>
                            <li><b>Genetic Factors:</b> While MS is not directly inherited, certain genetic variations may increase the risk of developing MS, particularly in those with a family history.</li>
                            <li><b>Environmental Triggers:</b> Environmental factors such as viral infections, toxins, low vitamin D levels, and smoking may act as triggers in genetically susceptible individuals.</li>
                            <li><b>Immune System Dysfunction:</b> MS results from an immune system malfunction, where it targets the myelin sheath, disrupting nerve functions.</li>
                            <li><b>Other Factors:</b> Hormonal changes and autoimmune conditions may also contribute to MS development.</li>
                        </ul>
