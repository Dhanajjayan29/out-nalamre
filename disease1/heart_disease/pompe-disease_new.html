                        <p>
                            Pompe disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes muscle weakness and respiratory problems. It results from the accumulation of glycogen in the cells due to a deficiency in the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA), which is responsible for breaking down glycogen.

                        <p>
                            Pompe disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both parents must carry the mutated gene for a child to inherit the condition. The primary cause is a mutation in the GAA gene, which impairs the body's ability to break down glycogen.

                        <p>Risk factors include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Family history of Pompe disease.</li>
                            <li>Being born with a genetic mutation of the GAA gene.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            The symptoms of Pompe disease can vary depending on the severity of the condition. Common symptoms include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Muscle weakness, especially in the legs and trunk.</li>
                            <li>Breathing difficulties due to weakened respiratory muscles.</li>
                            <li>Enlarged heart (cardiomegaly).</li>
                            <li>Fatigue and difficulty with physical activities.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Although there is no cure for Pompe disease, several treatments can help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life:
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="text-primary">Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT):</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ERT involves the intravenous infusion of the missing enzyme, acid alpha-glucosidase, to help break down glycogen in cells.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="text-primary">Supportive Care:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical therapy, respiratory support, and medications may help manage symptoms.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Prevention Tips</h4>
                        <p>As Pompe disease is a genetic condition, prevention is not possible. However, early detection and treatment can help manage symptoms and improve outcomes. Genetic counseling is recommended for families with a history of Pompe disease.</p>
