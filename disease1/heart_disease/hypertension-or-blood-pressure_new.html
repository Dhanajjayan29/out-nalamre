                            <li>Family history - If your parents or close relatives have high blood pressure, you may be at higher risk.</li>
                            <li>Obesity - Excess weight increases the strain on your heart.</li>
                            <li>Physical inactivity - Lack of exercise increases the risk of hypertension.</li>

                            High blood pressure often has no symptoms, which is why it is often called a "silent killer." However, in some cases, people with severely high blood pressure may experience:
