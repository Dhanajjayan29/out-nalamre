                        <p>A sperm disorder, also known as male factor infertility, refers to any condition that affects the production, quality, or function of sperm, thereby reducing the likelihood of conception during sexual intercourse. There are various types of sperm disorders, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Oligospermia:</strong> A low sperm count, where there are fewer sperm present in a semen sample than the normal range (usually fewer than 15 million sperm per milliliter).</li>
                            <li><strong>Azoospermia:</strong> The absence of sperm in the semen, classified into obstructive azoospermia (blocked sperm) and non-obstructive azoospermia (low sperm production).</li>
                            <li><strong>Teratospermia:</strong> Abnormal sperm morphology, meaning that a significant percentage of sperm have abnormal shapes, which can hinder their ability to fertilize an egg.</li>
                            <li><strong>Asthenospermia:</strong> Reduced sperm motility, making it difficult for sperm to swim effectively and reach the egg.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hypospermia:</strong> A low volume of semen ejaculated, indicating possible problems with semen production or ejaculation function.</li>
                            <li><strong>Necrospermia:</strong> The presence of dead sperm in the semen, which cannot fertilize an egg.</li>
                            <li><strong>Oligoasthenoteratospermia (OAT syndrome):</strong> A condition combining low sperm count, poor sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <section class="mb-5">
                        <h3 class="text-secondary">Causes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hormonal Imbalances:</strong> Low testosterone or high estrogen levels can affect sperm production and function.</li>
                            <li><strong>Genetic Factors:</strong> Genetic abnormalities like Klinefelter syndrome or Y chromosome deletions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Testicular Factors:</strong> Conditions like undescended testicles, testicular trauma, or cancer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Varicocele:</strong> Enlarged veins in the scrotum can affect sperm production by increasing testicular temperature.</li>
                            <li><strong>Infections:</strong> Infections like gonorrhea or chlamydia can damage the reproductive organs.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lifestyle Factors:</strong> Smoking, excessive alcohol use, drug use, obesity, and environmental toxins.</li>
                            <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Certain drugs like chemotherapy, testosterone replacement therapy, or high blood pressure medications can affect sperm production.</li>
                            <li><strong>Radiation or Chemotherapy:</strong> These treatments can damage sperm-producing cells in the testicles.</li>
                            <li><strong>Heat Exposure:</strong> Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can reduce sperm production.</li>
                            <li><strong>Age:</strong> As men age, sperm quality and quantity may decline.</li>
                            <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Chronic stress may affect hormonal balance and sperm production.</li>
                            <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Can disrupt hormone levels and sperm production.</li>
                        </ul>
