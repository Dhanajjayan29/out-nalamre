                        <p>
                            Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects the airways in the lungs. In individuals with asthma, the airways become inflamed and swollen, making them more sensitive to certain triggers. When exposed to these triggers, the airways may constrict, making it difficult for air to pass through. This leads to symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness.

                        <p>
                            Asthma is typically classified into two main types:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Allergic asthma:</b> Triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or mold.</li>
                            <li><b>Non-allergic asthma:</b> Triggered by factors such as respiratory infections, exercise, cold air, smoke, pollution, or emotional stress.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                        <h3 class="text-primary section-heading">Causes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Genetic predisposition:</b> Asthma tends to run in families, suggesting that genetic factors play a role in its development. People with a family history of asthma or other allergic conditions are at higher risk of developing asthma themselves.</li>
                            <li><b>Allergens:</b> Common allergens associated with asthma include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold, and cockroach droppings.</li>
                            <li><b>Respiratory infections:</b> Viral respiratory infections, such as the common cold, influenza, or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can trigger asthma symptoms.</li>
                            <li><b>Environmental factors:</b> Exposure to environmental pollutants like tobacco smoke, air pollution, and chemical irritants.</li>
                            <li><b>Exercise and physical activity:</b> Exercise-induced asthma is triggered by physical exertion or exercise.</li>
                            <li><b>Weather changes:</b> Cold air, humidity, and changes in temperature can trigger asthma symptoms.</li>
                            <li><b>Emotional factors:</b> Stress, anxiety, and strong emotions can worsen asthma symptoms.</li>
                            <li><b>Other factors:</b> Factors like certain medications and medical conditions (e.g., GERD) may contribute to asthma development or exacerbation.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Wheezing:</b> A high-pitched whistling sound when breathing out.</li>
                            <li><b>Coughing:</b> Persistent coughing that may worsen at night or early in the morning.</li>
                            <li><b>Shortness of breath:</b> Difficulty breathing or feeling like you can't get enough air.</li>
                            <li><b>Chest tightness:</b> A sensation of pressure or squeezing in the chest.</li>
                            <li><b>Difficulty sleeping:</b> Asthma symptoms often worsen at night, making it hard to sleep.</li>
                            <li><b>Difficulty speaking:</b> Severe asthma symptoms can impair speech.</li>
                            <li><b>Coughing or wheezing during exercise:</b> Exercise-induced asthma is common in some individuals.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><b>Long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs):</b> Relax the muscles around the airways (e.g., Salmeterol, Formoterol).</li>
                            <li><b>Short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs):</b> Provide rapid relief during an asthma attack (e.g., Albuterol, Levalbuterol).</li>
                            <li><b>Leukotriene modifiers:</b> Help reduce inflammation (e.g., Montelukast, Zafirlukast).</li>
                            <li><b>Combination inhalers:</b> Contain both corticosteroids and beta-agonists (e.g., Advair, Symbicort).</li>
                            <li><b>Biologic therapies:</b> For severe asthma (e.g., Omalizumab, Mepolizumab).</li>
                            <li><b>Oral corticosteroids:</b> Prescribed for short-term use during severe episodes (e.g., Prednisone).</li>
                            <li><b>Allergy shots (immunotherapy):</b> Reduces sensitivity to allergens.</li>
