                        <p>Pneumonia is a common respiratory infection that affects the lungs. It can be caused by various microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites. When someone has pneumonia, the air sacs in the lungs, known as alveoli, become inflamed and filled with fluid or pus, making it difficult for oxygen to reach the bloodstream.</p>

                    <section class="mb-5">
                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Causes</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Bacteria:</b> Bacterial pneumonia is one of the most common types of pneumonia. It can be caused by various bacteria, with Streptococcus pneumoniae being the most frequent culprit. Other bacteria that can cause pneumonia include Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus.</li>
                            <li><b>Viruses:</b> Viral pneumonia is typically caused by respiratory viruses such as influenza virus (flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus. Viral pneumonia tends to be more common in children and is often less severe than bacterial pneumonia, although it can still cause serious illness, especially in vulnerable populations.</li>
                            <li><b>Fungi:</b> Fungal pneumonia is less common and usually affects individuals with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, or individuals undergoing chemotherapy. Fungal pneumonia can be caused by organisms such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus species.</li>
                            <li><b>Other pathogens:</b> Less commonly, pneumonia can be caused by parasites such as Pneumocystis jirovecii, which primarily affects individuals with compromised immune systems.</li>
                            <li><b>Aspiration:</b> Aspiration pneumonia occurs when foreign substances, such as food, drink, saliva, or vomit, are breathed into the lungs instead of being swallowed into the digestive tract. This can lead to infection and inflammation, particularly in individuals with impaired swallowing reflexes, neurological disorders, or those who have experienced a loss of consciousness.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In addition to infectious agents, certain risk factors can increase the likelihood of developing pneumonia, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Age (very young children and the elderly are at higher risk)</li>
                            <li>Weakened immune system (due to conditions such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, or certain medications)</li>
                            <li>Chronic lung diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis)</li>
                            <li>Smoking</li>
                            <li>Underlying medical conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes, or liver disease)</li>
                            <li>Recent respiratory infections</li>
                            <li>Exposure to pollutants or environmental irritants</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                    <section class="mb-5">
                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Symptoms</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Cough:</b> A persistent cough is a common symptom of pneumonia. The cough may produce phlegm or pus, which can be yellow, green, or bloody in color.</li>
                            <li><b>Fever:</b> Pneumonia often causes fever, with temperatures typically exceeding 100.4°F (38°C). The fever may be accompanied by chills and sweating.</li>
                            <li><b>Difficulty breathing:</b> Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing is a hallmark symptom of pneumonia. Individuals may experience rapid, shallow breathing or feel like they can't catch their breath, especially with exertion.</li>
                            <li><b>Chest pain:</b> Chest pain is another common symptom of pneumonia. The pain may be sharp or stabbing and can worsen with coughing or deep breathing.</li>
                            <li><b>Fatigue:</b> Pneumonia can cause fatigue and weakness, which may persist even after other symptoms improve.</li>
                            <li><b>Bluish tint to the lips or nails:</b> In severe cases of pneumonia, a bluish tint to the lips or nails (cyanosis) may develop, indicating a lack of oxygen in the blood.</li>
                            <li><b>Confusion:</b> Older adults or individuals with weakened immune systems may experience confusion or changes in mental status as a result of pneumonia.</li>
                            <li><b>Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea:</b> Some people with pneumonia may experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, particularly if the infection is caused by certain bacteria.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Treatment: Modern Medicine</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Antibiotics:</b> If the pneumonia is caused by bacteria, antibiotics are typically prescribed to help fight the infection. Common antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia include azithromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and ceftriaxone.</li>
                            <li><b>Antiviral medications:</b> If the pneumonia is caused by a viral infection, antiviral medications may be prescribed, especially if the patient is at high risk of complications. For example, antiviral medications like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) may be used for influenza-related pneumonia.</li>
                            <li><b>Antifungal medications:</b> Fungal pneumonia can be treated with antifungal medications such as fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B.</li>
                            <li><b>Oxygen therapy:</b> In severe cases of pneumonia where oxygen levels are low, patients may need oxygen therapy to help them breathe. This may involve using a nasal cannula or a face mask to deliver supplemental oxygen.</li>
                            <li><b>Hospitalization:</b> Some individuals with pneumonia may require hospitalization for closer monitoring, intravenous antibiotics or fluids, and respiratory support.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <section class="mb-5">
                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Prevention</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Vaccination:</b> Vaccines are available to help prevent certain types of pneumonia, such as the pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13 and PPSV23) and the influenza vaccine. Vaccination is especially important for young children, older adults, and individuals with chronic medical conditions.</li>
                            <li><b>Good hygiene practices:</b> Practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly, can help prevent the spread of bacteria and viruses that cause pneumonia.</li>
                            <li><b>Quit smoking:</b> Smoking damages the lungs and increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Quitting smoking can help reduce this risk.</li>
                            <li><b>Healthy lifestyle:</b> Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and proper hydration, can help strengthen the immune system and reduce the likelihood of infections like pneumonia.</li>
                        </ul>
