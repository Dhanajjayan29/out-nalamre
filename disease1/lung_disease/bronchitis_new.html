                        <p>
                            Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, the air passages that carry air to the lungs. It can be acute, usually caused by viruses like those that cause colds and flu, resulting in symptoms such as cough, sore throat, and fever, and typically resolves within a few weeks. Chronic bronchitis, a type of COPD, involves persistent coughing with mucus production for at least three months, recurring for two consecutive years, often due to smoking or exposure to lung irritants.

                        <h3 class="text-primary section-heading">Causes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Acute bronchitis:</strong> This type of bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, particularly the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). It typically develops after a respiratory infection, such as a cold or the flu. Acute bronchitis is characterized by a cough that may produce mucus, along with symptoms like sore throat, fever, and chest discomfort. It usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chronic bronchitis:</strong> This form of bronchitis is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It's characterized by a productive cough that lasts for at least three months, with recurring bouts occurring for at least two consecutive years. Chronic bronchitis is often caused by smoking or exposure to lung irritants over an extended period. It leads to persistent inflammation and irritation of the bronchial tubes, which can result in coughing up thickened mucus and breathing difficulties.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Bronchitis can be uncomfortable and disruptive to daily life, but it's usually not serious for otherwise healthy individuals. However, chronic bronchitis can significantly impact lung function and quality of life, particularly if it's not managed properly.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-primary section-heading">Symptoms</h3>
                        <p>Symptoms of bronchitis can vary depending on whether it is acute or chronic, but they generally include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Cough:</strong> This is often the most prominent symptom and may produce mucus (sputum). The cough may be dry or productive (producing mucus).</li>
                            <li><strong>Sore throat:</strong> Irritation and discomfort in the throat may accompany the cough.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chest discomfort:</strong> You may feel tightness or discomfort in the chest, particularly with coughing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> Feeling tired or exhausted is common, especially if the body is fighting off an infection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Shortness of breath:</strong> Especially with exertion or during physical activity, you may find it harder to breathe.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fever:</strong> In some cases, particularly with acute bronchitis, you may experience a low-grade fever.</li>
                            <li><strong>Wheezing:</strong> This is more common in cases of chronic bronchitis or if there's significant airway obstruction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>These symptoms can vary in severity and may overlap with other respiratory conditions. In acute bronchitis, symptoms usually develop over a few days and can last for several weeks, while in chronic bronchitis, symptoms may persist for months or years with periods of exacerbation and remission.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Acute Bronchitis:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Medications: Non-prescription medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce fever and relieve discomfort.</li>
                                    <li>Cough suppressants and expectorants: These medications can help control coughing and loosen mucus if it's difficult to cough up.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Chronic Bronchitis:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Medications: Your doctor may prescribe bronchodilators to help open up airways and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.</li>
                                    <li>Oxygen therapy: If your oxygen levels are low, supplemental oxygen can help improve breathing.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In some cases, if bronchitis is caused by bacteria (less common in acute cases), antibiotics may be prescribed. However, antibiotics are not effective against viral infections, which are the most common cause of acute bronchitis.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Hydration: Drinking plenty of fluids helps keep mucus thin and easier to cough up.</li>
                            <li>Humidifier or steam: Inhaling moist air from a humidifier or a steamy shower can help soothe irritated airways and loosen mucus.</li>
                            <li>Warm beverages: Drinking warm teas, broths, or soups can provide relief for a sore throat and help keep you hydrated.</li>
                            <li>Honey and ginger: Some traditional remedies involve honey and ginger, which may have soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While traditional remedies can help relieve symptoms, they are not a substitute for medical treatment, especially in cases of chronic or severe bronchitis.</p>
