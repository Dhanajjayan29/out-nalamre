                        <p>STD stands for Sexually Transmitted Disease. It refers to infections that are typically transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. STDs can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Some common examples of STDs include chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV/AIDS, genital herpes, HPV (human papillomavirus), and trichomoniasis. STDs can have serious health consequences if left untreated, including infertility, chronic pain, organ damage, and an increased risk of HIV transmission. It's important to practice safe sex, get tested regularly, and seek medical treatment if you suspect you have an STD.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-primary section-heading">Causes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sexual Contact: Most STDs are primarily transmitted through sexual activity, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Direct contact with infected genital, oral, or anal mucous membranes, as well as with genital secretions or fluids, can spread the infection from one person to another. Unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected individual is a significant risk factor for acquiring STDs.</li>
                            <li>Vertical Transmission: Some STDs can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth or pregnancy. This is known as vertical transmission. Examples include HIV, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV).</li>
                            <li>Blood-to-Blood Contact: STDs such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C can be transmitted through contact with infected blood. This can occur through sharing needles or syringes contaminated with infected blood, or through blood transfusions from infected donors (although modern blood screening procedures have greatly reduced this risk).</li>
                            <li>Skin-to-Skin Contact: Certain STDs, such as genital herpes and HPV, can be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected area, even if there are no visible sores or symptoms present. This can occur during sexual activity or through other forms of close physical contact.</li>
                            <li>Non-Sexual Contact: Although less common, some STDs can be transmitted through non-sexual means. For example, trichomoniasis can potentially be transmitted through sharing damp towels or bathing suits with an infected person. However, sexual contact remains the primary mode of transmission for most STDs.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Genital Discharge: Unusual discharge from the penis or vagina may be a symptom of certain STDs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis. The discharge may be thick, cloudy, greenish, yellowish, or bloody.</li>
                            <li>Painful Urination: Pain or burning sensation during urination can be a sign of urinary tract infection (UTI), which is often associated with certain STDs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, or genital herpes.</li>
                            <li>Genital Sores or Ulcers: Painful sores, blisters, or ulcers on the genitals or around the mouth may indicate infections such as genital herpes, syphilis, or chancroid.</li>
                            <li>Genital Itching or Irritation: Itching, redness, or irritation in the genital area can be symptoms of various STDs, including genital herpes, pubic lice (crabs), or trichomoniasis.</li>
                            <li>Pain or Discomfort During Sexual Intercourse: Pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) can be a symptom of certain STDs, such as genital herpes, chlamydia, or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).</li>
                            <li>Lower Abdominal Pain or Pelvic Pain: Persistent lower abdominal pain or pelvic pain may be a sign of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can be caused by untreated chlamydia or gonorrhea.</li>
                            <li>Swollen Lymph Nodes: Enlarged, tender lymph nodes in the groin area or elsewhere in the body may be a sign of an underlying infection, including some STDs.</li>
                            <li>Fever or Flu-Like Symptoms: Some STDs, particularly those that cause systemic infections, may lead to symptoms such as fever, fatigue, body aches, and swollen glands.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="text-primary section-heading">Treatment: Modern Medicine</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Bacterial Infections (e.g., Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis):</b> Antibiotics are the primary treatment for bacterial STDs. For example, azithromycin or doxycycline may be prescribed for chlamydia, while gonorrhea is often treated with a combination of antibiotics such as ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Syphilis can be treated with penicillin or other antibiotics, depending on the stage of the infection.</li>
                            <li><b>Viral Infections (e.g., Genital Herpes, HIV, Hepatitis B):</b> Viral STDs cannot be cured, but medications can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of transmission. Antiviral medications such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir are used to manage genital herpes outbreaks. For HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is prescribed to suppress the virus and prevent progression to AIDS. Hepatitis B can be managed with antiviral medications like tenofovir or entecavir.</li>
                            <li><b>HPV and Genital Warts:</b> There is no cure for HPV, but treatments are available to manage symptoms. Genital warts may be treated with topical medications like imiquimod or podofilox, or they may be removed through cryotherapy, electrocautery, or laser treatment. Vaccines such as the Gardasil vaccine can prevent certain types of HPV, reducing the risk of genital warts and cervical cancer.</li>
                            <li><b>Parasitic Infections (e.g., Trichomoniasis, Pubic Lice):</b> Trichomoniasis is typically treated with the antibiotic metronidazole or tinidazole. Pubic lice (crabs) are treated with topical insecticides such as permethrin or pyrethrin, along with washing infested clothing and bedding.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Use Condoms: Consistent and correct use of condoms during vaginal, anal, and oral sex significantly reduces the risk of STDs.</li>
                            <li>Get Vaccinated: Vaccines are available to prevent certain STDs, including the HPV vaccine (Gardasil) and the hepatitis B vaccine.</li>
                            <li>Get Tested Regularly: Regular STD testing is important for sexually active individuals, particularly if they have multiple partners or engage in unprotected sex.</li>
                            <li>Limit Sexual Partners: Reducing the number of sexual partners and engaging in monogamous relationships can reduce the risk of contracting STDs.</li>
                            <li>Communicate with Partners: Open and honest communication about sexual health with partners is essential for preventing the spread of STDs.</li>
                            <li>Avoid Sharing Needles: Do not share needles or other drug paraphernalia to reduce the risk of bloodborne STDs like HIV and hepatitis.</li>
