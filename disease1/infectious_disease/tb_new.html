                            Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It primarily affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body, such as the kidneys, spine, and brain. TB spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing tiny infectious droplets that can be inhaled by others.

                        <p>
                            Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The disease spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, releasing tiny infectious droplets containing the bacteria. Some common causes and risk factors for TB include:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Close Contact with an Infected Person: Close and prolonged contact with someone who has active TB increases the risk of contracting the disease.</li>
                            <li>Weak Immune System: Individuals with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to TB infection and are at higher risk of developing active TB disease. This includes people living with HIV/AIDS, those undergoing chemotherapy or organ transplantation, and those taking immunosuppressive medications.</li>
                            <li>Overcrowded and Poorly Ventilated Environments: TB is more likely to spread in crowded and poorly ventilated settings, such as prisons, refugee camps, and homeless shelters.</li>
                            <li>Substance Abuse: Alcohol and drug abuse can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to TB infection.</li>
                            <li>Malnutrition: Poor nutrition can weaken the immune system, increasing the risk of TB infection and progression to active disease.</li>
                            <li>Age: TB can affect individuals of any age, but older adults are more likely to develop active TB due to weakened immune systems.</li>
                            <li>Travel or Migration to High TB Burden Areas: Traveling to or living in regions with high rates of TB increases the risk of exposure to the bacteria.</li>
                            <li>Healthcare Settings: Healthcare workers may be at increased risk of TB infection due to exposure to infected patients.</li>
                            <li>Drug Resistance: Misuse or incomplete use of antibiotics can lead to the development of drug-resistant strains of TB, which are more difficult to treat.</li>
                            <li>Genetic Factors: Some genetic factors may increase susceptibility to TB infection or influence the body's response to the bacteria.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <section class="mb-5">
                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Symptoms</h4>
                        <p>
                            The symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) can vary depending on whether the infection is latent (inactive) or active.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="text-primary">Latent TB Infection (LTBI):</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Latent TB infection typically doesn't cause any symptoms. People with latent TB infection have TB bacteria in their bodies, but their immune systems keep the bacteria in check, preventing them from causing symptoms or spreading the disease to others.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="text-primary">Active TB Disease:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Persistent Cough: A cough that lasts more than three weeks is one of the most common symptoms of active TB. The cough may produce sputum or even blood.</li>
                            <li>Chest Pain: Pain or discomfort in the chest may occur, especially during coughing or breathing.</li>
                            <li>Fatigue and Weakness: Feeling tired, weak, or experiencing unexplained weight loss may be signs of active TB.</li>
                            <li>Fever: A low-grade fever, particularly in the afternoon or evening, is common in people with active TB.</li>
                            <li>Night Sweats: Profuse sweating, especially at night, can be a symptom of TB.</li>
                            <li>Loss of Appetite: Decreased appetite and unintended weight loss are often observed.</li>
                            <li>Shortness of Breath: Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath may occur, especially as the disease progresses.</li>
                            <li>Chills: Some people with active TB may experience chills or a feeling of coldness.</li>
                            <li>Swollen Lymph Nodes: Swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the neck, may occur in cases of TB affecting the lymph nodes (extrapulmonary TB).</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Treatment: Modern Medicine</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Isoniazid (INH): Isoniazid is a cornerstone of TB treatment. It is usually taken daily for at least 6 months for the treatment of drug-susceptible TB. It is also used in the treatment of latent TB infection.</li>
                            <li>Rifampin (RIF): Rifampin is another key drug used in TB treatment. It is often taken in combination with isoniazid, typically for 6 months. Rifampin is highly effective in killing TB bacteria and is a crucial component of multi-drug treatment regimens.</li>
                            <li>Pyrazinamide (PZA): Pyrazinamide is used in the initial phase of TB treatment to help kill TB bacteria more effectively. It is usually taken in combination with other drugs.</li>
                            <li>Ethambutol (EMB): Ethambutol is often added to TB treatment regimens to help prevent the development of drug resistance. It is used in combination with other TB medications.</li>
                            <li>Second-Line Drugs: For drug-resistant TB, second-line drugs such as fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin) and injectable agents like amikacin may be used. These drugs are less effective and have more potential side effects than first-line treatments.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Vaccination: The Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine is used to prevent TB in some countries, especially for newborns and infants at high risk.</li>
                            <li>Proper Hygiene Practices: Covering the mouth and nose with a tissue or mask when coughing or sneezing helps prevent the spread of TB bacteria to others.</li>
                            <li>Air Circulation: Ensuring proper ventilation in living and working spaces reduces the concentration of TB bacteria in the air.</li>
                            <li>Early Diagnosis and Treatment: Early detection of TB and adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen can prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
                            <li>Strengthening the Immune System: Proper nutrition, vaccination, and addressing other underlying health conditions help prevent TB infection in susceptible individuals.</li>
                            <li>Screening and Monitoring: TB screening programs can help identify and treat latent TB infection before it progresses to active disease.</li>
