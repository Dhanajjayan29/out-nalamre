                        <p>Malaria is a potentially deadly infectious disease caused by parasites of the Plasmodium genus. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. There are several species of Plasmodium parasites, but the most common ones that cause malaria in humans are Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale.</p>

                    <section class="mb-5">
                        <h3 class="text-secondary">Causes</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mosquito Bite: When an infected female Anopheles mosquito bites a human host to feed on blood, it injects saliva containing the malaria parasites into the person's bloodstream.</li>
                            <li>Parasite Entry: Once inside the human body, the malaria parasites travel to the liver, where they multiply and develop into forms known as merozoites.</li>
                            <li>Bloodstream Invasion: The merozoites are released into the bloodstream from the liver cells, where they infect red blood cells.</li>
                            <li>Red Blood Cell Infection: Inside the red blood cells, the parasites multiply further, causing the cells to burst open, releasing more parasites into the bloodstream.</li>
                            <li>Mosquito Infection: When another mosquito bites an infected person, it ingests the malaria parasites along with the person's blood.</li>
                            <li>Mosquito Reproduction: Inside the mosquito, the parasites undergo further development, eventually reaching the stage where they can infect another human host when the mosquito takes another blood meal.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>Jaundice: In severe cases, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) may develop.</li>
                            <li>Anemia: Malaria can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><strong>Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs):</strong> ACTs are the recommended first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum.</li>
                            <li><strong>Chloroquine:</strong> Chloroquine was once widely used for the treatment of malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quinine:</strong> Quinine is an older medication still used in some cases, particularly for severe malaria.</li>
                            <li><strong>Other Antimalarials:</strong> Depending on the specific circumstances, other medications such as atovaquone-proguanil, primaquine, and tafenoquine may be used.</li>
