                        <p>
                            Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can infect animals and humans. They can cause respiratory illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The term "corona" comes from the Latin word for crown, describing the appearance of the viral particles under a microscope, which have spike-like projections resembling a crown. A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China.

                        <p>
                            The primary mode of transmission for COVID-19 is through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes. These droplets can land in the mouths, noses, or eyes of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into their lungs. Additionally, COVID-19 can spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching one's face, especially the mouth, nose, or eyes. However, this is not the main way the virus spreads, but it can still contribute to transmission.
