                        <p>
                            Dengue is a viral infection transmitted primarily by Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti. It is caused by the dengue virus, which belongs to the Flaviviridae family. Dengue fever is commonly found in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide, especially in urban and semi-urban areas.

                        <p>
                            Dengue fever is caused by the dengue virus, which is primarily transmitted to humans through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes, particularly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. These mosquitoes become infected when they feed on the blood of a person already infected with the virus.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once inside the mosquito, the dengue virus replicates and spreads throughout the mosquito's body, eventually reaching its salivary glands. When the infected mosquito then bites another person to feed on their blood, it injects the virus into the person's bloodstream, thereby transmitting the infection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Humans are the primary host for the dengue virus, and the virus cannot be transmitted directly from person to person. However, in rare cases, the virus can be transmitted through blood transfusions or organ transplants from infected donors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's important to note that not all mosquitoes carry the dengue virus, and not all individuals who are bitten by an infected mosquito will develop dengue fever.

                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Symptoms</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>High fever: Dengue fever often begins with a sudden onset of high fever, typically reaching temperatures of 104°F (40°C) or higher.</li>
                            <li>Severe headache: Headaches, often described as intense and throbbing, are a common symptom of dengue fever.</li>
                            <li>Pain behind the eyes: Many individuals with dengue fever experience pain or discomfort behind the eyes, which can worsen with eye movement.</li>
                            <li>Joint and muscle pain: Dengue fever can cause severe joint and muscle pain, often affecting the lower back, knees, and other large joints.</li>
                            <li>Fatigue: Feelings of extreme tiredness and fatigue are common during dengue infection.</li>
                            <li>Nausea and vomiting: Some individuals may experience nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite.</li>
                            <li>Skin rash: A rash may appear on the skin a few days after the onset of fever. The rash is typically red and can appear on the trunk, arms, legs, and face.</li>
                            <li>Mild bleeding: Dengue fever may cause mild bleeding, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or easy bruising.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="text-secondary">Treatment: Modern Medicine</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fluid Replacement: Adequate hydration is essential, especially in cases of dengue fever where there is a risk of dehydration due to high fever, vomiting, and decreased oral intake. In mild cases, oral rehydration solutions may be sufficient. However, in more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be required to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance.</li>
                            <li>Fever Management: Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used to reduce fever and relieve pain. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen should be avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding.</li>
                            <li>Rest: Getting plenty of rest is important to help the body recover from the infection and conserve energy.</li>
                            <li>Monitoring: Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid balance, and hematocrit levels (to detect dehydration or hemoconcentration) is crucial, especially in severe cases of dengue fever.</li>
                            <li>Blood Transfusion: In cases of severe dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) or dengue shock syndrome (DSS) where there is severe bleeding or a significant drop in blood pressure, blood transfusions may be necessary to replace lost blood volume and improve oxygen delivery to tissues.</li>
                            <li>Hospitalization: Individuals with severe dengue infection, such as those with DHF or DSS, may require hospitalization for close monitoring and supportive care, including intravenous fluids and other medical interventions.</li>
                            <li>Platelet Transfusion: In some cases of severe dengue fever where there is significant thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and bleeding, platelet transfusions may be considered to prevent or manage bleeding complications.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Herbal Teas: Some herbal teas, such as ginger tea or peppermint tea, may help relieve nausea and soothe an upset stomach. Chamomile tea may also promote relaxation and sleep.</li>
                            <li>Fruits and Vegetables: Consuming fruits and vegetables rich in vitamins and antioxidants can help support the immune system and promote overall health. Examples include citrus fruits (e.g., oranges, lemons), papaya, and leafy greens.</li>
                            <li>Hydration with Coconut Water: Coconut water is often used in traditional medicine to help rehydrate the body and replenish electrolytes during illness. It can also help soothe the stomach and promote digestion.</li>
                            <li>Turmeric and Honey: Turmeric, known for its anti-inflammatory properties, may be combined with honey to create a soothing remedy for sore throats and coughs associated with dengue fever.</li>
                            <li>Neem: In some traditional medicine practices, neem leaves are used as a remedy for dengue fever due to their purported anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. However, it's important to note that scientific evidence supporting its efficacy is limited.</li>
