                        <p>Meningitis is an inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges. It is typically caused by an infection, although it can also result from certain medications, autoimmune disorders, or other types of infections. The most common causes of meningitis are viral and bacterial infections.</p>
                        <p>Viral meningitis is often less severe than bacterial meningitis and typically resolves on its own with supportive care. Bacterial meningitis, on the other hand, is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics. If left untreated, bacterial meningitis can lead to serious complications, including brain damage, hearing loss, and death.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Infectious Agents: The most common cause of meningitis is viral and bacterial infections. These microorganisms can enter the body through various means, such as respiratory droplets, contaminated food or water, or direct contact with an infected person. Some common infectious agents include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>Viral: Enteroviruses (such as coxsackievirus and echovirus), herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox and shingles), and others.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Bacterial: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Listeria monocytogenes, and others.</p></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><p>Non-Infectious Causes: Meningitis can also occur due to non-infectious factors, such as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>Chemical Irritation: Certain chemicals, medications, or environmental toxins can irritate the meninges and cause inflammation. For example, reactions to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or certain intravenous medications.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Fungal or Parasitic Infections: Fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans and parasites like Angiostrongylus cantonensis can cause meningitis.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Autoimmune Disorders: Conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Beh√ßet's disease can trigger inflammation in the meninges.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Cancer: Meningitis can occur as a complication of cancer, particularly if cancer cells spread to the meninges (carcinomatous meningitis).</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Post-surgical or Traumatic: Meningitis can develop after neurosurgery or head trauma.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Congenital Conditions: Some individuals may be predisposed to meningitis due to structural abnormalities or immune system deficiencies.</p></li>
