                        <p>Myositis is a chronic, progressive inflammation of the muscles. Some types are associated with skin rashes. Medications and exercises can help, but finding the right treatment may take trial and error.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-secondary">Types of Myositis</h3>
                        <p>The types of myositis are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Polymyositis:</b> This type of myositis primarily affects the skeletal muscles, causing weakness and inflammation.</li>
                            <li><b>Dermatomyositis:</b> In addition to muscle weakness and inflammation, dermatomyositis also involves skin rash, typically on the face, knuckles, elbows, knees, or chest.</li>
                            <li><b>Inclusion Body Myositis:</b> Characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy, particularly in the hands, fingers, forearms, and quadriceps muscles. It tends to progress slowly over time.</li>
                            <li><b>Juvenile Myositis:</b> This type of myositis affects children and adolescents, including both polymyositis and dermatomyositis.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                    <!-- Causes -->
                    <section class="mb-5">
                        <h3 class="text-secondary">Causes</h3>
                        <p>This rare disease can be difficult to diagnose, and the cause is sometimes unknown. In the United States, there are an estimated 1,600 to 3,200 new cases per year, with 50,000 to 75,000 people living with myositis.</p>
                        <p>Reasons for Cause:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Autoimmune Response:</b> Myositis is often considered an autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks its own muscles, leading to inflammation and weakness.</li>
                            <li><b>Genetic Factors:</b> Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to myositis, making them more susceptible to the condition.</li>
                            <li><b>Environmental Triggers:</b> Exposure to certain environmental factors, such as infections or toxins, may trigger or exacerbate myositis in susceptible individuals.</li>
                            <li><b>Age and Gender:</b> Certain types of myositis, like inclusion body myositis, are more common in older adults. Juvenile dermatomyositis, on the other hand, affects children and adolescents.</li>
                        </ul>
