                        <p>Infections can be caused by various types of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Each type of pathogen has distinct characteristics, and infections can manifest differently depending on the microorganism involved.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Bacterial Infections:</h4>
                        <p>Bacteria are single-cell organisms that can reproduce on their own. They can enter the body through openings like the mouth, nose, cuts, and surgical incisions. Most bacteria are beneficial, like those aiding in digestion in the gut.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Viral Infections:</h4>
                        <p>Viruses require living cells to survive and reproduce by hijacking healthy cells. Common examples include influenza, herpes, and COVID-19. Unlike bacteria, viruses cannot survive independently on surfaces.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Fungal Infections:</h4>
                        <p>Fungi cause infections that can affect skin, nails, or internal organs, thriving in warm, moist environments. Examples include athleteâ€™s foot, ringworm, and candidiasis.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Parasitic Infections:</h4>
                        <p>Parasites live on or inside other organisms for survival. Protozoa can cause infections like malaria and giardiasis. These infections are often transmitted through contaminated food, water, or insect bites.</p>
