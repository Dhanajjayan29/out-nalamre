                        <ul>
                            <li>A lipoma is a slow-growing, fatty lump that's most often situated between your skin and the underlying muscle layer.</li>
                            <li>A lipoma, which feels doughy and usually isn't tender, moves readily with slight finger pressure.</li>
                            <li>Lipomas are usually detected in middle age. Some people have more than one lipoma.</li>
                            <li>A lipoma isn't cancer and usually is harmless.</li>
                            <li>Treatment generally isn't necessary, but if the lipoma bothers you, is painful or is growing, you may want to have it removed.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="text-primary section-heading">Causes</h3>
                        <p>No specific causes are known for lipoma development, though genetics may play a role. The exact reason for the fat cells growing abnormally is still unclear.</p>

                        <h5>Lipomas can occur anywhere in the body. They are typically:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Situated just under the skin. They commonly occur in the neck, shoulders, back, abdomen, arms, and thighs.</li>
                            <li>Soft and doughy to the touch. They also move easily with slight finger pressure.</li>
                            <li>Generally small. Lipomas are typically less than 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter, but they can grow.</li>
                            <li>Sometimes painful. Lipomas can be painful if they grow and press on nearby nerves or if they contain many blood vessels.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Diagnosis</h5>
                        <p>To diagnose a lipoma, your doctor may perform:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A physical exam</li>
                            <li>A tissue sample removal (biopsy) for lab examination</li>
                            <li>An X-ray or other imaging test, such as an MRI or CT scan, if the lipoma is large, has unusual features or appears to be deeper than the fatty layer.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>No treatment is usually necessary for a lipoma. Lipoma treatments include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Surgical removal</strong></li>

                        <p>Several factors may increase your risk of developing a lipoma, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Being between 40 and 60 years old.</strong> Although lipomas can occur at any age, they're most common in this age group.</li>
                            <li><strong>Genetics.</strong> Lipomas tend to run in families.</li>
