                            Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism are conditions related to the thyroid gland. The thyroid is responsible for regulating metabolism, and when it is either overactive (hyperthyroidism) or underactive (hypothyroidism), it can lead to a variety of symptoms and health problems.
