                        <p>
                            Cold and cough are common conditions in children. These respiratory illnesses, although generally mild, can sometimes lead to complications if not properly managed. It is crucial for parents to understand the right treatment options, including medication, and be aware of potential risks associated with over-the-counter medicines.

                        <p>Several types of medications are commonly used to treat cold and cough in children:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medicines:</b> These include antihistamines, decongestants, and cough suppressants. Medications like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or dextromethorphan (Robitussin) may help alleviate symptoms of cold and cough.</li>
                            <li><b>Honey:</b> For children over 1 year, honey is a natural remedy known to help soothe a sore throat and reduce coughing.</li>
                            <li><b>Saline Nasal Drops/Spray:</b> These can help relieve nasal congestion and ease breathing.</li>
                            <li><b>Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Advil):</b> Used to manage fever and reduce pain or discomfort associated with a cold or cough.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            While medications can help relieve symptoms, it's important to understand the risks associated with certain treatments, especially for children. Here are the key risks:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Over-the-Counter Medicines:</b> Many OTC cold and cough medicines are not recommended for children under 6 years due to the risk of side effects such as drowsiness, agitation, and even overdose. Always consult a doctor before administering these medications.</li>
                            <li><b>Honey:</b> While honey can be helpful for children over 1 year, it should not be given to infants due to the risk of botulism, a rare but serious illness caused by bacteria.</li>
                            <li><b>Decongestants:</b> These can cause side effects like increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and sleep disturbances, especially in young children.</li>
                            <li><b>Inappropriate Dosage:</b> Incorrect dosing of OTC medications or prescriptions can lead to toxicity. Always follow dosing instructions carefully, and never administer adult formulations to children.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3 class="text-primary section-heading">When to See a Doctor</h3>
                        <p>
                            If your child’s symptoms persist for more than a week or if they develop severe symptoms like high fever, difficulty breathing, or persistent cough, it is important to seek medical advice. A healthcare provider can recommend the most appropriate treatment and ensure the child's safety.
