                        <p>Vaccines have played a crucial role in saving millions of lives worldwide. Below are key facts about vaccines and their impact on public health:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Immunization Saves Lives:</b> Vaccines are among the most successful health interventions ever, saving more than 20 life-threatening diseases.</li>
                            <li><b>No Link Between Vaccines and Autism:</b> Extensive research has proven there is no link between vaccines and autism, dispelling this harmful myth.</li>
                            <li><b>COVID-19 Vaccines:</b> The introduction of COVID-19 vaccines has been instrumental in controlling the pandemic and reducing severe cases, hospitalizations, and death rates.</li>
                            <li><b>Effectiveness:</b> Vaccines are highly effective in preventing diseases. For example, the polio vaccine has nearly eradicated the disease, and smallpox was completely eradicated due to vaccines.</li>
                            <li><b>Herd Immunity:</b> When a large portion of the population is vaccinated, it protects those who are unable to receive vaccines, such as individuals with compromised immune systems.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Myth: Vaccines Cause Diseases:</b> <br> Fact: Vaccines are designed to prevent diseases by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight off harmful pathogens, not cause them.</li>
                            <li><b>Myth: Vaccines are Unsafe:</b> <br> Fact: Vaccines are rigorously tested for safety in clinical trials, and their benefits far outweigh any risks. Serious side effects are rare.</li>
                            <li><b>Myth: Natural Immunity is Better Than Vaccine Immunity:</b> <br> Fact: Vaccines provide immunity without causing illness, unlike natural infections, which can lead to serious complications and long-term health problems.</li>
                            <li><b>Myth: COVID-19 Vaccines Alter DNA:</b> <br> Fact: COVID-19 vaccines do not alter your DNA. They work by instructing cells to produce a harmless part of the virus, prompting the immune system to respond.</li>
                            <li><b>Myth: Vaccines are Only for Children:</b> <br> Fact: Vaccines are important for people of all ages. Adults need vaccines, including flu shots, tetanus boosters, and vaccines for diseases like shingles and pneumonia.</li>
